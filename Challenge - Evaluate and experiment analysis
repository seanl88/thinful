1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Dark Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

There is clearly a conditional bias based on the person that is delivering the slogan. They should control for the person delivering the slogan and then will be able to get a proper result.

2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

There is clearly sample bias here. They should have Jar Jar and Windu visit all the same worlds. The test didn't specify the breakdown of worlds either, but we're going to remove that bias, by sending them to each world.

3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

The diversity of the countries that the IT workers are in is higher than that of the HR workers. There is sample bias along with contextual bias. I would control for each country to introduce more accurate results.

4. When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

There is sample bias present here. I assume that people that exercise more are more comfortable sharing their exercise info. Additionally, they are probably the type that wants to set and acheive milestones, therefore, more likely to work continue to improve. Instead of asking people to opt in, I would set it up so that they would have to opt out. This would make more people sign up and therfore broaden your sample.

5. To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

There is sample bias here because we don't know what students took the test. It is possible that the smarter students randomly picked up the test. She should instead distribute the tests evenly accross the class to ensure a clean sample.
