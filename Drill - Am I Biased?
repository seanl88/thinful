You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.


    #You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the
    other in May.

    There is clear contextual bias with the bathing suit ad email because women are not shopping for the same things in February
    that they are in May. There is also conditional bias as the condition of the shoppers is clearly different when it is cold
    vs. when it is warm.
    
    #You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general
    population.
    
    Sampling bias is clearly at play because people that have anxiety will use an anxiety clinic more than people that don't
    have a need for it.
    
    Context is clearly also different again, due to the fact that people are in a treatment center. Patients are going to be
    more forthright with their symptoms than the general population, because they are in a treatment center.
    
    #You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
    
    The sample size is too small. One weeks worth of data is not enough to determine if the billboard had an impact.
    
    #You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
    
    Sample size is again too small.
    
    Additionally, the loyalty program has no context. It could be to much loyalty needed. Or the reward isn't valued.
