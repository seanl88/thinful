The Problem

How do we increase recruits to the dark side? Our numbers are fading and all we have to show for the last few years is Lord Vader. He's great with his signature throat choke move, but we need more.

The Potential Solution

Change our recruiting slogan. The old "give in to your anger" needs to be updated. Trying "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." could be the answer.


The Method

Use each slogan on half of the captured droids. Both the Sith lord and Darth Vader should use each phrase for half of their audience. 

This is an A/B manipulation where both phrases get equal use from different people delivering them.

If the success rate for Sith and Vader are the same we will know it doesn't matter who delivers the message. If the success rate is different by the phrase, then we will know which one is effective and whic one is less effective.
