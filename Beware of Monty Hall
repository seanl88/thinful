My initial thinking about the Monty Hall challenge was to do nothing.
I assumed that the likelihood that I chose the right door only improved once a wrong door was eliminated.

Initially there were 3 doors:

Door one == .33 chance of having the price
Door two == .33 chance of having the price
Door three == .33 chance of having the price

After the host showed us that there was nothing behind door x, my assumption was that the probability changed to this:

Door one == .50 chance of having the price
Door two == .50 chance of having the price

Initially the probability was 1/3. My thinking was that after the host opened the door and there wasn't anything behind it,
that that information didn't change the probability of me being right or wrong in a different way.

To me, Bayes didn't inform the decision as to why the probability changed. Removing a posibility of the prize being behind a
door made me step back to the original probability and recalculate with only two options.

What I found after researching the problem was that I was incorrect. The probability does not change to 50/50.

The reason for this is because the host opens up a losing door first every time (on purpose). I assumed that the choice was
random.

From Savant:

"When you first choose door #1 from three, there’s a 1/3 chance that the prize is behind that one and a 2/3 chance that it’s 
behind one of the others. But then the host steps in and gives you a clue. If the prize is behind #2, the host shows you #3, 
and if the prize is behind #3, the host shows you #2. So when you switch, you win if the prize is behind #2 or #3. You win 
either way! But if you don’t switch, you win only if the prize is behind door #1."
