For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

    Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
    Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
    Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
    If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?



Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

My hypothesis: 

I expect the supplement group to acheive better sleep than the control group.

Set up A/B with two groups: 

One group that takes the supplement and one group that doesn't take it.

Select the sample: 

Choose a sample of people that are roughly the same age, in the same physical shape, have no children, report low levels of stress and sleep during the night (don't work during the night and sleep at day). 

The method:

Have half of the people in the test take the supplement and monitor all sleepers' sleep quality though sleep monitoring technology.

Mandate that all screens are turned off at 9pm every night.

We will judge sleep quality based on circadian rythms and REM sleep over the next three months.

Measuring outcomes:

If the sleep quality of the supplement takers is 10% better than the non-supplement takers we'll conclude that the supplement has an effect on people's sleep. If the sleep quality of the supplement takers stays the same, we will conclude the supplement has no effect. If the supplement takers' sleep quality decreases, we will extend the study another 3 months to determine if it actually has a negative effect.



Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

Hypothesis:

I expect that new uniforms will not have an effect on a gym's business.

Set up A/B with two groups:

Employees wear new uniforms at location A while employees where current uniforms at location B.

Select the sample:

Choose a sample of people that come to the gym to sign up for a new membership, excluding people that currently attend the gym.

The method:

Measure the new membership sign ups for the gyms of the next 6 months.

Ensure that the sales pitch and sales skill levels of each employee are similar.

Measuring outcomes:

If the sign up for new memberships at the gym where the new uniforms are being warn are 10% higher than the new memberships that were sold at the gym where the current uniforms are sold then we will conclude that the new uniforms have an effect. 

If new memberships are less that 10% but more than -10% at the gym where new uniforms are being worn, then we will conclude that there was no difference. 

If new memberships are less than -10% at the new uniform store, then we will conclude that they had a negative effect.


Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

Hypothesis:

I believe that a new home page will improve my online exotic pet rental business.

Set up A/B with two groups:

50% of users will be directed to the old web page and 50% of users will be directed to the new web page.

Select the sample:

For this sample group we'll pick people that visit the website and spend more than 60 seconds on the website.

The method:

Measure the number of rentals between to the two cohorts.

Measuring outcomes:

If the rentals for the new webpage are are 10% higher than the rentals from the old page then we will conclude that the new page has an effect. 

If rentals from the new website are less that 10% but more than -10% than the old website, then we will conclude that there was no difference. 

If new memberships are less than -10% at the new website, then we will conclude that they had a negative effect.


If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

Hypothesis:

I believe that putting please read in the email subject will get more people to read my emails.

Set up A/B with two groups:

50% of people I send my email to will have please read and the other 50% will be sent normally.

Select the sample:

For this sample group we'll include everyone that I send an email to at work.

The method:

Measure the percent difference between the two groups in email open rate.

Measuring outcomes:

If the opens for the new email are are 10% higher than the old email then we will conclude that the new email has an effect. 

If the opens for the new email are less that 10% but more than -10% the opens for the old email, then we will conclude that there was no difference. 

If the opens for the new email are less than -10% than the opens for the old email, then we will conclude that they had a negative effect.
